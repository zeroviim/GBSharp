A GameBoy emulator with the goal of data mining.

This is a work-in-progress with the goals of learning how to write an emulator, and how to give the user tools to data mine their favorite games for any unused content.

Currently working towards getting the CPU interpreter in, then video.
After that sound.
Then front end tidying up.
